Interface Segregation Principal

'I' in SOLID Principals http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/Principles_and_Patterns.pdf

"Many client specific interfaces are better than one general purpose interface" 
	- Bob Martin http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/Principles_and_Patterns.pdf

In a Nutshell: Clients shouldn't depend on methods they do not consume.

"The essence of the principle is quite simple. If you have a class that has several clients,
rather than loading the class with all the methods that the clients need, create
specific interfaces for each client and multiply inherit them into the class." 
	- (Uncle) Bob Martin http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/Principles_and_Patterns.pdf
