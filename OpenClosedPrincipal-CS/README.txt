"software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification"
- Bertrand Meyer


1. They are “Open For Extension”.
This means that the behavior of the module can be extended. That we can make 
the module behave in new and different ways as the requirements of the application change, or to meet the needs of new applications.
2. They are “Closed for Modi?cation”.
The source code of such a module is inviolate. No one is allowed to make source 
code changes to it.
